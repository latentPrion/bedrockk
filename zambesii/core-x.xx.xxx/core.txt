The "core" folder in a zambesii distribution is a read only directory that
only holds no real files. Instead, it is a mount of the kernel's endo-kernel FS.

This way, the user can see what is inside of EKFS just by opening this folder.
EKFS drivers for Zambesii by nature do not support writing, so the EKFS is
irrevocably read-only. The only way to modify the EKFS that was included with a
kernel image is to modify (generally rebuild) the kernel image itself.

At some future point, we will begin to support separate EKFSs, and then a user
can edit/rebuild his/her EKFS separately from his/her kernel.
