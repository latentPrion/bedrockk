The kernel executable is installed here with a file name following the format
of this text file's name. If there are multiple versions of Zambesii installed
on the same drive, their executables are named differently.

zambesii<bits>-v.vv.vvv.zxe
	<bits>: "32" or "64"
	v.vv.vvv: Version of the kernel image.

Since zambesii is mostly a microkernel, its executable size should not usually
exceed about 2MiB. At any rate, only the files that are absolutely necessary to
boot and orient the kernel are included along with it in the EKFS.
