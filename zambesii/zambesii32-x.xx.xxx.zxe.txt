The kernel executable is installed here. If there are multiple versions of
zambesii installed on the same drive, their executables are named differently.

Since zambesii is mostly a microkernel, its executable size should not usually
exceed about 2MiB. At any rate, only the files that are absolutely necessary to
boot and orient the kernel are included along with it in the EKFS.
